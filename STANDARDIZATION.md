# STANDARDIZATION.md
# ASAP Standardization Roadmap

This document outlines the intended pathway for formal recognition
and standardization of the ASAP (AI Site Agent Protocol).

---

## Purpose

The goal of standardization is to:

- Establish ASAP as a recognized protocol for AI-verified website answers
- Enable interoperability across AI platforms
- Maintain canonical reference control
- Ensure that any extensions remain compatible

---

## Standardization Bodies Considered

1. **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**
   - Suitable for protocol-level specification
   - Intent: Publish as an RFC

2. **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**
   - Suitable for web-based protocols and APIs
   - Intent: Web standard for registry and agent discovery

3. **ISO / IEC**
   - Suitable for global adoption in regulated industries
   - Focus: Trust, cryptography, and interoperability

---

## Recommended Approach

### Step 1 — RFC Draft
- Publish ASAP v0.1 as a public Internet-Draft
- Include:
  - Core architecture
  - Registry API
  - Agent protocol
  - Security & trust model
- Invite technical community review

### Step 2 — Community Feedback
- Collect feedback from:
  - AI research labs
  - Universities
  - Open-source implementers
- Publish revisions

### Step 3 — RFC Publication
- After review cycles, submit for **RFC publication**
- RFC becomes canonical reference

### Step 4 — Optional W3C Submission
- Submit registry and agent discovery as **W3C Note**
- Use for broader web interoperability

### Step 5 — Ecosystem Adoption
- Encourage early adopters
- Track pilot projects
- Gather metrics for official compliance

---

## Key Principles

- **Canonical Reference:** The GitHub repository and v0.1 Whitepaper remain the reference.
- **Open Process:** All discussions, drafts, and revisions are public.
- **Non-exclusive Ownership:** No single entity owns the protocol.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Versioning and deprecation guidelines ensure stability.

---

## Security and Trust Considerations

- Registry & agent cryptography must be documented
- Threat model must accompany any standard submission
- Signature verification is mandatory

---

## Timeline (Suggested)

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Draft Publication | 1–2 months | Publish v0.1 as Internet-Draft |
| Community Review | 2–3 months | Collect feedback and iterate |
| RFC Submission | 1 month | Submit to IETF for publication |
| Optional W3C Note | 1–2 months | Submit for web interoperability |
| Adoption Tracking | Ongoing | Pilot implementations & metrics |

---

## Status

- Version: 0.1 Draft  
- Repository: canonical reference  
- Ready for community feedback and pilot implementations
